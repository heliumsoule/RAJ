##Flow (Fluid Flow 2D Tank Shooter)

Li Roger
Lin Jing
Rehab Arfan

##Group Roles: 

Arfan - Creating the frontend that hosts Fluid Flow Tanks, implementing the introduction JavaScript animation.

Roger - Integrating the fluid flow from the Navier Stokes Equation with the terrain map and the powerups and implementing collision detection.

Jing - Modeling the Navier Stokes Equation and rendering the Fluid Flow vortices in the map that curve the bullets from the Tanks. Designing the graphics for the tanks, terrain, and powerups.

##User Interaction
Two Users head to the Fluid Flow Tanks website and choose their Tank Avatars. Then they hit Enter and a randomly generated terrain map with fluid vortices are created. Powerups, upgrades, and different types of bullets are dropped at random intervals and locations. Some powerups may be associated with defeating another Avatar on the screen if time permits our coding it. Users each have to move around the screen and fire bullets at each other while taking in the random trajector of the fluid flow to curve their bullets at each other.

One User wins when the LifePoints of the other Tank is zero.
