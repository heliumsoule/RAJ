##Group Roles: 

Arfan - Creating the frontend that hosts Fluid Flow Tanks, implementing the introduction JavaScript animation.

Jing - Modeling the Navier Stokes Equation and rendering the Fluid Flow vortices in the map that curve the bullets from the Tanks. Designing the graphics for the tanks, terrain, and powerups.

Roger - Integrating the fluid flow from the Navier Stokes Equation with the terrain map and the powerups and implementing collision detection.

##Game Mechanics
Flow is a 2D Tank Shooter game that implements the Navier Stokes PDE in physics to change the trajectory of bullets. Two players choose their tank avatars and enter a randomly selected terrain map with fluid vortices that twist the trajectories of the bullets. Users have to aim their bullets while taking into account that curvature to hit each other and win. Powerups, upgrades, and different types of bullets are dropped at random intervals and locations. The bullets and walls (boundaries) and edge of the screen change the trajectories of the fluid, making the game challenging and fun!
