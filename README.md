##Group Roles: 

Arfan - Creating the frontend that hosts Fluid Flow Tanks, implementing the WASD and Arrow Keys to move the tanks and the Space Bar and Shift 
to shoot bullets. A scoreboard which contains the high scores of the players is also within the scope of the frontend.

Roger - Integrating the fluid flow from the Navier Stokes Equation with the terrain map and the powerups: mines, different types of bullets, powerups,
and upgrades into Fluid Flow Tanks. 

Jing - Modeling the Navier Stokes Equation and rendering the Fluid Flow vortices in the map that curve the bullets from the Tanks. Includes both the creation of the waves and the curvature specification of the bullets on impact with the waves.

##Group Leader:

TBD

##User Interaction
Two Users head to the Fluid Flow Tanks website and choose their Tank Avatars. Then they hit Enter and a randomly generated terrain map with fluid vortices
are created. Powerups, upgrades, and different types of bullets are dropped at random intervals and locations. Some powerups may be associated with defeating another Avatar on the screen if time permits our coding it. Users each have to move around the screen and fire bullets at each other while taking in the random trajector of the fluid flow to curve their bullets at each other.

One User wins when the LifePoints of the other is cut to zero.

**If time permits, we can consider an Android app.**

##By Friday 3/28/14

Arfan - Create the skeleton website, with the appropriate documentation and styling.

Roger - Brainstorm different powerups, upgrades, and types of bullets. Logistically, thinking about how different
elements of Fluid Flow Tanks can be combined into one exciting experience.

Jing - Figure out how to implement the Navier Stokes Equation in JavaScript.
